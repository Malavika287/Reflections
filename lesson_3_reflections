Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When multiple people are working on the same project. Also when you want to showcase the work to others.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. In case others are modifying the repositroy we don't want all of the changes they make to reflect in our local repository. Hence it is always helpful to have that flexibility.
