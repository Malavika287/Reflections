Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When multiple people are working on the same project. Also when you want to showcase the work to others.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. In case others are modifying the repositroy we don't want all of the changes they make to reflect in our local repository. Hence it is always helpful to have that flexibility.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. Fork is a copy of work created by someone else on Github. This is used when you don't have permission to modify the original. Clone is used when a local copy of is created. 
Branches are used within a local repository when separate parts of the same code are created.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A. Having a local copy of the last known state of the remote helps us in understanding the state from which local changes started. It also gives a reference to merge the local changes with the remote changes made by other contributors.

Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A. We can use common folders and send mails to the team requesting for review if the team doesn't use Github. With Github, the process is much easier when the reviewers can be automatically set.
