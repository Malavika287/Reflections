What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


All the files in the directory are treated as a combined entity. The changes in each of those files are then tracked in a .git metadata file. The files are tracked henceforth for any changes made.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


It is the intermediate area between a working directory and the repository. The working directory is the place where all the files are initially created and saved.the staging then gives the flexibility of committing 
only those files which are required in a single commit to make it a logical chunk. The reposirtory is the place where the history astarts to get accrued at every commit. Unless a file goes to repository its commit history is not tracked.
